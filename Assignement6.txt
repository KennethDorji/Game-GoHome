CISC 3110 - Assignment #6 - Implementing a Simple Board Game (version #5)

Overview

In the previous assignments you designed a program that played the board game Go Home! In this assignment, you will begin moving toward an object oriented design. As such, you will have at least one class, and at least one array of objects. Details follow. 

Note: Many of you have already implemented a Player class. That is great and can be counted towards this assignment. However, you will need to have member functions, including constructor(s), so there is still some work to be done for most of you. 

Once again -- save your work! There will be one more version of the program.
Classes

Since each player has several attributes: a name (string), a location (int), and possibly others, it makes sense to define a class to represent a player. Each Player object will represent a single player, while an array of Player objects will represent the list of Players that are playing the game.
All member variables (that is, the data) of the class must be private. You should include member functions for the player class such as "moveForward".
You may include some accessor ("getter") and mutator ("setter") functions, however, do not include a "setLocation" function that allows the user to set a Player's location.
Split your program into at least 3 files: Player.h, Player.cpp, and pgm6.cpp
I recommend first writing a version with exactly 2 players, and only once that works, modify (as you did in version 2) to work with up to 6 players.
In addition to the Player class, feel free to add any other class that you find useful.
